# Vedant-EDA
Performed EDA using python on Diwali sales data and Amazon sales data.  Performed Data cleaning and converted unfiltered data into a structured format. Used libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas for data visualization.

## Project Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of two datasets:
- 2)Diwali Sales Data – Understanding sales patterns during the Diwali season.
- 3)Amazon Sales Data – Analyzing product sales trends on Amazon.
- The goal of this project is to uncover key insights, visualize trends, and identify patterns that can aid business decision-making.

## Datasets
1. Diwali Sales Data
- <a href= "https://github.com/Vedant2331/Vedant-EDA/blob/main/Diwali%20Sales%20Data.csv">Diwali Sales Data</a>
- Description: Contains data on product sales, revenue, discounts, and customer behavior during Diwali.

2. Amazon Sales Data
- <a href= "https://github.com/Vedant2331/Vedant-EDA/blob/main/Amazon%20Sale%20Report.csv">Amazon Sales Data<a/>
- Description: Contains data on Amazon product sales, ratings, and customer reviews.

## Tools & Libraries
The EDA is performed using Python with the following libraries:
- Pandas – Data manipulation
- Numpy – Numerical computations
- Matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization
- Plotly – Interactive visualizations (optional)
- Jupyter notebook – Analysis and documentation

## Key Insights
- 1)Top-selling products during Diwali: [List top products]
- 2)Peak sales period: [Date range/month]
- 3)Most profitable categories: [Categories]
- 4)Amazon products with highest ratings and sales: [Products]
- 5)Correlation between discount and revenue: [Observation]

## Analysis Workflow
- 1)Data Loading – Import CSV/Excel datasets using pandas.
- 2)Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
- 3)Data Transformation – Create derived columns and standardize formats.
## Exploratory Analysis
- 1)Summary statistics
- 2)Correlation analysis
- 3)Trend analysis (monthly, yearly, seasonal)
## Data Visualization
- 1)Bar charts, line charts, and histograms
- 2)Box plots for outlier detection
- 3)Heatmaps for correlation
- 4)Interactive plots for detailed insights
- Key Insights & Recommendations – Summary of findings and actionable insights.

## Jupyter Document
- <a href="https://github.com/Vedant2331/Vedant-EDA/blob/main/Amazon%20Sales%20Report.ipynb">Amazon Report</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/Vedant2331/Vedant-EDA/blob/main/Python%20Diwali%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb">Diwali Report</a>

## Conclusion
This EDA provides a comprehensive overview of Diwali and Amazon sales trends, helping businesses understand customer behavior, identify profitable products, and optimize marketing strategies.
