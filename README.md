# Vedant-EDA
Performed EDA using python on Diwali sales data and Amazon sales data.  Performed Data cleaning and converted unfiltered data into a structured format. Used libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas for data visualization.

##Project Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of two datasets:
2)Diwali Sales Data – Understanding sales patterns during the Diwali season.
3)Amazon Sales Data – Analyzing product sales trends on Amazon.
The goal of this project is to uncover key insights, visualize trends, and identify patterns that can aid business decision-making.

##Datasets
1. Diwali Sales Data
- <a href= "https://github.com/Vedant2331/Vedant-EDA/blob/main/Diwali%20Sales%20Data.csv">Diwali Sales Data</a>
Description: Contains data on product sales, revenue, discounts, and customer behavior during Diwali.

2. Amazon Sales Data
- <a href= "https://github.com/Vedant2331/Vedant-EDA/blob/main/Amazon%20Sale%20Report.csv">Amazon Sales Data<a/>
Description: Contains data on Amazon product sales, ratings, and customer reviews.

##Tools & Libraries
The EDA is performed using Python with the following libraries:
Pandas – Data manipulation
Numpy – Numerical computations
Matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization
Plotly – Interactive visualizations (optional)
Jupyter notebook – Analysis and documentation

Key Insights
Top-selling products during Diwali: [List top products]
Peak sales period: [Date range/month]
Most profitable categories: [Categories]
Amazon products with highest ratings and sales: [Products]
Correlation between discount and revenue: [Observation]

##Analysis Workflow
Data Loading – Import CSV/Excel datasets using pandas.
Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Data Transformation – Create derived columns and standardize formats.
Exploratory Analysis
Summary statistics
Correlation analysis
Trend analysis (monthly, yearly, seasonal)
Data Visualization
Bar charts, line charts, and histograms
Box plots for outlier detection
Heatmaps for correlation
Interactive plots for detailed insights
Key Insights & Recommendations – Summary of findings and actionable insights.
